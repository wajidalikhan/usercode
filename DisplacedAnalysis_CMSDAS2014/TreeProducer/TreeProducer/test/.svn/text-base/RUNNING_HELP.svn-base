GUIDE TO RUNNING TREE PRODUCER

-have access to PAT tuples created by the MakePatTuple step
-the sample cff file corresponding to the PAT tuples of a sample need to be updated with the list of PAT files (see isntructions in MakePatTuples step for more info)

- Check out code

In the src directory of a CMSSW release (e.g. 5_3_5):

svn co svn+ssh://ejclemen@svn.cern.ch/reps/displacedfermions/trunk/TreeProducer
svn co svn+ssh://ejclemen@svn.cern.ch/reps/displacedfermions/trunk/SampleFiles

The tree producer can run on local PAT tuples or via crab on published PAT tuples

For local running (i.e. on batch system) the list of PAT files the tree producer will run over is in each individual sample cff file (in SampleFiles/Samples/python/).
If there's no files listed in there you either need to make some PAT tuples first, or ask the person who has made pat tuples to update the sample cff files in svn/check you have the most up to date version of the sample cff files from svn.

For running via crab, the DBS name of the sample will be in the sample cff file (Unless the person who produced a particular PAT tuple hasn't committed the sample cff file to svn)

-To run the tree producer on a single sample, do (e.g. from the src directory) :

python TreeProducer/TreeProducer/test/run_treeProducer.py SampleFiles/Samples/python/Data_Mu_Run2012A1_cff.py RAL

Arguments :
1) A sample cff file - make sure the pat file list has been updated
2) Where or how you are running the job.  Currently supports "CERN", "RAL" and "CRAB".

For "CERN" and "RAL", this script will submit a number of batch jobs to the batch system on lxplus (or equivalent at RAL)

For "CRAB", a number of crab jobs will be created.  You also need to provide an extra argument (0 or 1) to let the script know whether to auto create and submit the crab jobs.

-To run the tree producer en masse :

python TreeProducer/TreeProducer/test/runAllTreeProducer.py data CERN

Arguments :
1) Which type of samples to run on.  Choose from:
	
	data 
	signal 
	background 
	qcd 
	vectorboson 
	all

2) Where/how you are running


The jobs will produce histograms_N.root files in the workdirs/SAMPLE_analysis directories. They can be merged by running mergeAllFiles.py from workdirs/:

- cp mergeAllFiles.py mergeFiles.py $LOCALRT/src/workdirs/
- ./mergeAllFiles.py

Be careful, as there are options (commented out) that will remove all stderr and stdout along with all histograms_*.root files.
This is intended to make cleaning up easier once you are confident that the merged histogram.root file is good.

If you have run via crab, you will probably have to write your own script to merge the histograms_*.root file yourself.
