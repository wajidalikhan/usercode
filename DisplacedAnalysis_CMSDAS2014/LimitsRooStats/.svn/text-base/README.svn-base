This repository contains the code for the limit calculation using the Bayesian limits based on roostats_cl95.

Please note that the background tools that used to also live in this directory have now been moved to
displacedfermions/trunk/BackgroundTools.

For full documentation, please consult DOCS.

Prior to its current location, it lived in Andrzej's svn repository in
https://svn.cern.ch/reps/zuranski/LLlimits.

A few revisions of note in that repository:

r58 was the final version which contains only the winter scripts remaining; this was the version which was ported
to the current repository.

r54 is the "green light" version which contains the summer and winter scripts for the version green-lighted by the
ARC.

r44 is the "frozen" version prior to (winter) preapproval.
