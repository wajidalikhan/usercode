HIN-11-011 analysis flow
(all the codes have been tested with ROOT 5.30.00)

***** 1. Input data samples *****
	HI central tree from OniaToMuMuSkim
	150/mub PbPb data: /castor/cern.ch/user/t/tdahms/Jpsi_Histos_181611-183013_150invmub.root
	230/nb pp data: /castor/cern.ch/user/t/tdahms/Jpsi_Histos_ppReReco.root


***** 2. Make flat dimuon trees *****
    Run script "MakeTree_2012.c" with PbPb or pp input data sample. 
	The output trees are also stored in:
	/castor/cern.ch/user/z/zhenhu/HeavyIons/Onia/Data2011/dimuonTree_HI2011_fulldataset_trkRot.root
	/castor/cern.ch/user/z/zhenhu/HeavyIons/Onia/Data2011/dimuonTree_2011_pp.root


***** 3. Simultaneous fit *****
	To run, edit "simQuickFit.py" to point to the location of the data files.
	Run "python simQuickFit.py" to get double ratio or R_AA.
	Additional options availible with "python simQuickFit.py -h".

	The default background option for PbPb is "--bkgd_PbPb=3", while for pp is "--bkgd_pp=4". All the other backgound options for systematic study are: 
		1 - use RooKeysPdf to smooth the like-sign, then fit unlikesign with keys+pol.1
		2 - use RooKeysPdf to smooth the like-sign, then fit unlikesign with keys+pol.2
		3 - use erf*exp to fit the unlike-sign
		4 - use pol.2 to fit the unlike-sign
		5 - use pol.1 to fit the unlike-sign
		6 - use erf*exp to fit like-sign, then fit unlikesign with keys+pol.1
		7 - use erf*exp to fit like-sign, then fit unlikesign with keys+pol.2
		8 - use erf*exp to fit the unlike-sign
	If you would like to use the track-rotation spectrum instead of the like-sign spectrum, simply turn on the option "--trkRot" (default is "False"). 

	The default parameterization is to fit for double ratio x2 and x3 ("buildSimPdf_f2f3.cc"). But we provided 4 different options:
		--build=buildSimPdf_f2f23.cc  - fit for nsig1S_pp, nsig1S_PbPb, x2, x23, r2_pp, r23_pp 
		--build=buildSimPdf_f2f3.cc   - fit for nsig1S_pp, nsig1S_PbPb, x2, x3, r2_PbPb, r3_PbPb 
		--build=buildSimPdf_yields.cc - fit for nsig1S_pp, nsig1S_PbPb, nsig2S_pp, nsig2S_PbPb, nsig3S_pp, nsig3S_PbPb
		--build=buildSimPdf_raa.cc    - fit for nsig1S_pp, nsig2S_pp, nsig3S_pp, raa1S, raa2S, raa3S
	You may edit any "buildSimPdf_*.cc" file if more changes are needed. 


***** 4. Significance *****
	Run "python nullSimFit_1SraaSignificance.py" to get the significance for Y1S suppression. You may change the parameterization to get significance for others, for example, Y2S R_AA, Y3S R_AA, double ratio...


***** 5. Signal ratio fitter *****
	Run "fitUpsilonYields.C" with ROOT. 
	Please check and change Line 43 ~ 60 before you run the code. All the variations should be tuned here, for example:
		To fit in a centrality bin, please set "fitMB = 0", and select the bin number;
		To change the background function for systematic study, please set 1 ~ 5 for bkgdModel;
		To use the track-rotation spectrum instead of the like-sign spectrum, please trun on "TRKROT = 1";
		To draw the PR plot, trun on "PR_plot = 1". Then, set "RAA = 1" for the R_AA PR plot, or set "RAA = 0" for the double ratio PR plot. 


***** 6. Draw the final R_AA and double ratio plots *****
	All the scripts are located in a subdirectory "UserCode/zhenhu/Hi2010/HIN-11-011/raaPlots". Please run each .c file to get the final plots.
